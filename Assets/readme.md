ghost_hit.wav and splash_effect.wav come from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZI4QhyO5ew

sword_swoosh.wav comes from: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/br37hc5hmgcphj2/AAAiL0If5TSX89foQ5qycTpoa?dl=0&preview=2.+Whoosh+Swoosh.wav

character_hit.wav comes from: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1HwHIB8CizR90lVg5n97IgojV3VqiIfgh as boom.wav

Due to hardware limitations, the PyBadge can only read a specific type of .wav file. If any problems should arise with them, pass them through an audio manipulation software like Audacity and download them onto the PyBadge. This should resolve the issue.
